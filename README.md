# SODMB

[Tipo](https://github.com/thetipo01) told me to make a music bot cause everyone else does too.

## About
This thing was going to be named borry2077 because Sery can't read.

It sucked, so i ripped off Typo's bot's name.

## Usage
Put token and prefix in a the config.toml file, build it and run it.

## TODO
- Audio cache
    - Replace JSON cold storage with SQL or something
    - Fix encoding artefacts when using compressed input
- Icecast song metadata (a bitch to parse, can't everyone just use lowercase?)
